The film is celebrated for its serene and tender portrayal of faith, emphasizing that how a person of faith lives is more significant than the circumstances of their death. Beauvois' direction is low-key and reflective, mirroring the monks' austere and thoughtful existence.\n\nThe narrative unfolds with a meticulous depiction of the monks' daily rhythms, capturing the lyrical and sensuous moments of their monastic life. This serene pace makes the eventual intrusion of violence all the more chilling and impactful. The film is both a moving parable of faith and a recounting of a real historical episode, exploring the monks' compassion and interconnectedness in the face of profound challenges.\n\nWhile some viewers may find the film's meditative pace and saintly portrayal of the monks to be overly austere, others are deeply moved by its humane and compassionate storytelling. The film's climax is described as misty and unforgettable, a testament to the monks' sacrifice and brotherhood. The performances of the cast are lauded for their grace and humility, conveying deep emotions with subtlety.\n\n\"Of Gods and Men\" is a beautiful, somber, and rigorously intelligent film that alternates between harrowing and humbling moments.

The movie, which also features Brad Pitt, is often described as a vanity project filled with beautiful imagery but lacking in substantial drama or emotional depth. Critics note that while the film is aesthetically pleasing, with its postcard vistas and glamorous costumes, it suffers from a slow pace, stilted dialogue, and a lack of compelling storytelling.\n\nMany reviews highlight the film's attempt to emulate European art cinema, but argue that it falls short, coming off as a parody rather than a genuine homage.

Directed by Yaron Zilberman, the movie centers on a renowned string quartet facing internal turmoil as they prepare for a significant performance. The film is praised for its insightful and incandescent portrayal of the creative nuances and emotional dynamics of classical music performance, making it appealing to both music and movie lovers.\n\nThe performances, particularly by Christopher Walken and Philip Seymour Hoffman, are often highlighted as the film's strongest aspect, showcasing a master class in acting. Walken's portrayal of the group's senior member is noted for its gentle and soulful quality. The ensemble cast, including Mark Ivanir and Catherine Keener, is commended for transcending the material's calculated moroseness and delivering emotionally potent performances.\n\nHowever, the film is not without its criticisms. Some reviewers find it slow, talky, and overly explicit, with a script that could have benefited from more restraint. The narrative is described as melodramatic and rife with trite plot conventions, leading to a sense of predictability. The film's attempt to balance farce and drama is seen as uneven, and its exploration of interpersonal conflicts sometimes detracts from its focus on music.\n\nDespite these flaws, \"A Late Quartet\" is recognized for its engaging scenario and the way it skillfully navigates the hermetic world of classical musicians. The screenplay, though old-fashioned and melodramatic, is stirring in its portrayal of individuals struggling with their egos to create something greater than themselves. The film's minimalistic approach is both a strength and a weakness, fitting the idea of the film better than its execution.\n\nIn summary, \"A Late Quartet\" is a film that offers distinct and

{"original_summary": "As beautifully animated as it is emotionally satisfying, Your Name adds another outstanding chapter to writer-director Makoto Shinkai's filmography.", "generated_summary": "\"Your Name\" is a visually stunning and emotionally engaging Japanese animated film directed by Makoto Shinkai. The story revolves around a boy and girl who mysteriously swap bodies, leading to a series of comedic and poignant moments as they navigate each other's lives. While the film lightly touches on gender and identity, it delves deeper into themes of fate, connection, and the complexities of adolescence.\n\nCritics praise the film's breathtaking animation, likening its vivid landscapes to a world sharpened and brightened after heavy rain. Shinkai's direction is noted for its ambition and emotional depth, even if the narrative occasionally stumbles over its own complexity.

The movie, directed by Penny Marshall and based on Beverly Donofrio's memoir, features Drew Barrymore in what some consider her finest role, portraying Beverly from ages 15 to 36. The film also benefits from strong performances by its supporting cast, particularly Steve Zahn.\n\nHowever, the film struggles with a superficial and often miscalculated script by Morgan Upton Ward, which leaves Beverly appearing as a passive victim in her own life. Critics note that the movie tends to smooth over the rough edges of Donofrio's life, opting for broad laughs and easy sentiment instead of the grit and honesty of the source material. This results in a narrative that feels forced, erratic, and at times overly sentimental.\n\nMarshall's direction is criticized for being heavy-handed, often downshifting the film's darker moments into low-gear cuteness, which undermines the potential for genuine bittersweetness. The film's attempt to balance humor and pathos is seen as strained, with some scenes coming off as overly broad or sitcom-like.\n\nDespite these flaws, the film is noted for its sincerity and heart, and for its ability to make viewers believe in the essential decency and capacity for love of its characters.

{"original_summary": "At once ethereal and tangible, Aleksandr Sokurov's humane Chechen War drama features a spectacular turn by opera star Galina Vishnevskay.", "generated_summary": "\"Alexandra,\" directed by visionary filmmaker Alexander Sokurov, is a haunting and contemplative drama that delves into the themes of war, generational relationships, and the human condition. Set against the backdrop of the Chechen war, the film offers a stark yet moving portrayal of soldiers on the front lines and the civilians caught in the conflict's wake. \n\nThe narrative centers around an octogenarian woman, Alexandra, played by the compelling Galina Vishnevskaya, who visits her grandson at a military outpost. Her presence, dragging a small wheeled luggage cart amidst the chaos of rolling tanks and military trucks, creates a striking visual incongruity that underscores the film's exploration of war's futility and the enduring human spirit.\n\nSokurov's direction is marked by a thoughtful, humanist approach, eschewing overt polemics in favor of a more subtle, emotionally resonant commentary on the horrors of war. The film's visuals are characterized by an eerie haze and bleached light, contributing to a pervasive sense of weariness and desolation. The dialogue, often toneless and teasing, complements the film's mysterious mixture of lightness and gravity.\n\n\"Alexandra\" is a quietly challenging film, particularly in its nuanced portrayal of old age and the complex emotions between mothers and the young men they send off to war. While some may find the anti-narrative approach soporific, the film's beauty and emotional depth are undeniable. It is a work that flourishes with repeated viewings, revealing more of its subtle intricacies each time.\n\nThough less accessible to general audiences than Sokurov's previous work \"The Sun,\" \"Alexandra\" deserves major accolades from film festivals and discerning arthouse viewers. It is a modest yet compelling film, with Vishnevskaya's performance standing out as particularly remarkable. In the end, \"Alexandra\" feels like a communiqu\u00e9 from another time and place, offering a profound meditation on the human condition amidst the ravages of war.", "matched_patterns": [["DT JJ NN

The film follows Yella, a reserved young woman portrayed by Nina Hoss, whose intelligence, larceny, and passion gradually come to light, elevating the narrative beyond a conventional thriller. \n\nThe story begins with an utterly gripping first 15 minutes, setting the stage for a suspenseful journey that delves into the murkier depths of capitalism. As Yella navigates her life, haunted by her deranged ex-husband and the ghosts of her past, the film unfolds with a frigid, menacing, and disquieting atmosphere. Petzold's direction ensures that the film remains tightly wound and precision-helmed, casting a coldly mesmerizing spell over the audience.\n\nWhile the film's symbolism may become heavy-handed towards the end, and the denouement slightly hackneyed, \"Yella\" still manages to tantalize the mind with its unresolved ending and subtle themes. Hoss' bewitching performance as the troubled number cruncher adds depth to the enigmatic and subtle narrative, making the film linger in the viewer's mind long after it concludes.\n\nThough some may find the film too obscure and oblique in its aims, \"Yella\" offers a deeply rewarding glimpse into a society haunted by its own past. It is a disquieting parable about trust and risk, wrong-footing the audience at every turn.

The film is plagued by juvenile performances, predictable plotlines, and stale humor, relying heavily on low-brow, scatological jokes and uninspired visual gags. The storyline is so formulaic that audiences can easily guess what happens next, and the acting is often worse than what one might see in a high school production.\n\nCritics universally panned the movie, describing it as a \"comedy for no ages\" with atrocious acting and a script that feels cobbled together. The film's reliance on CGI and slapstick humor, such as exploding toilets and runaway buses, fails to elicit genuine laughs. Even the presence of an Oscar-winning actor like Gooding Jr. can't save this mess, making his involvement almost painful to watch.\n\nThe movie's attempt at father-son bonding moments comes off as treacly and slows down the already dragging pace. The film's overall execution is so poor that it has been described as one of the most inept movies ever unleashed by a Hollywood studio. In summary, \"Daddy Day Camp\" is a generic, lazy, and unnecessary sequel that offers little more than a predictable and unenjoyable viewing experience.

Set in a small town, the movie combines elements of a straightforward whodunnit with a passionate critique of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) shortcomings. The film's narrative is built around an eco-apocalyptic scenario that is both terrifying and thought-provoking, drawing comparisons to \"The Blair Witch Project\" for its intelligent and dual-layered scares.\n\nWhile some critics find the film effective but ultimately hollow, others appreciate its schlocky yet conscientious approach to horror. Levinson's storytelling prowess elevates \"The Bay\" beyond a mere high-tech parlor trick, making it a compelling watch for both genre fans and eco-activists. The film's gruesome imagery and escalating tension are balanced by its underlying message about environmental responsibility, though some argue that this focus undermines its horror elements.\n\nDespite mixed reviews, \"The Bay\" is recognized for its ability to instill a genuine fear of environmental neglect, using jump scares and a faux-documentary style to engage viewers. It stands out as a smart, scary film that prompts audiences to Google the scientific information it presents, blending entertainment with activism.

{"original_summary": "A rare film that surpasses the quality of its source novel, this Devil is a witty expose of New York's fashion scene, with Meryl Streep in top form and Anne Hathaway more than holding her own.", "generated_summary": "\"The Devil Wears Prada\" is a film adaptation of Lauren Weisberger's bestselling novel, celebrated for its light, pleasurable, and entertaining take on the fashion industry. The movie is primarily an occasion to showcase Meryl Streep's exceptional comedic talent as the imperious editor of a glossy fashion magazine, a role that inspires both terror and awe. While the plot is familiar and doesn't delve deeply into its themes, the film's surface is dazzling, filled with killer clothes, a killer cast, and sharp, witty dialogue.\n\nStreep's performance is universally praised, elevating the film from a typical chick flick to an intoxicating character study. Her portrayal of the egomaniacal boss is nuanced, funny, and sinister, making her the standout element of the movie. However, when Streep is absent from the screen, the film's interest factor diminishes.\n\nThe movie is described as a lightweight, shallow comedy with a whimsical touch, offering a satirical glimpse into the insular world of fashion magazines. Despite some gaping plot holes and a timid approach to satire, it remains an enjoyable piece of pop entertainment, likened to a high-end TV show or a video version of Vogue.\n\nAnne Hathaway's role as a fresh-out-of-college aspiring journalist is less compelling, and the film's attempt to critique the fashion industry is seen as somewhat superficial. Nonetheless, \"The Devil Wears Prada\" is praised for its authentic look, dynamic dialogue, and the pleasure it provides in terms of fashion, luxury, power, and ambition.

{"original_summary": "Eccentric and sweet, Stephen Chow's latest is charming, but too strangely and slackly plotted to work as a whole.", "generated_summary": "**CJ7: A Mixed Bag of Slapstick, Sentimentality, and Surrealism**\n\nStephen Chow's latest film, *CJ7*, is a family-friendly comedy that diverges significantly from his previous works like *Kung Fu Hustle* and *Shaolin Soccer*. While it retains Chow's signature slapstick humor and imaginative special effects, it also ventures into new territory with its focus on family life and emotional themes.\n\nThe film has received mixed reviews, with some critics praising its heart and charm, while others criticize its uneven tone and lackluster story. The CGI-heavy slapstick may appeal to very young viewers, but the film's emotional content is often seen as superficial and inconsistent. Despite its flaws, *CJ7* does deliver a consistently passionate message about forgiveness and second chances.\n\nChow's attempt to blend sappy sentimentality with life-on-the-streets edginess results in a bizarre amalgam that doesn't always hit the mark. The film's third act, in particular, is criticized for its over-the-top sentimentality and lack of genuine emotional impact. Some reviewers also find the ending misjudged and evasive about the realities of life and death.\n\nHowever, the film does have its redeeming qualities. The presence of Xu Jiao, who plays her role with winsome charm without tipping her gender, keeps the audience engaged. There are also some nice surreal touches, such as casting enormous adults to play eight-year-olds, which add a layer of whimsy to the film.\n\nIn summary, *CJ7* is a hyperactive, wishful-thinking special effects fantasy that may entertain children and fans of Chow's previous work. However, its bizarre shifts in tone, lackluster story, and occasionally offensive elements make it a less compelling offering for a broader audience.", "matched_patterns": [["DT JJ NN IN", "a family-friendly comedy that"], ["IN DT JJ NN", "in a bizarre amalgam"], ["JJ NN IN DT", "compelling offering for a"], ["JJ NN IN DT", "mixed reviews, with some"], ["NN CC JJ NN", "tone and lackluster story."], ["NN CC JJ NN", "forgiveness and second chances."], ["NN CC JJ NN", "life and emotional themes."], ["VBZ DT JJ NN", "is a family-friendly comedy"], ["NN VBZ VBN IN", "particular, is criticized for"], ["NN IN JJ NN", "role with winsome charm"], ["DT JJ JJ NN", "The film's third act"], ["DT JJ JJ NN", "The film's third act,"], ["DT JJ JJ NN", "the film's emotional content"], ["IN PRP$ JJ NN", "Despite its flaws, *CJ7*"], ["IN PRP$ JJ NN", "for its over-the-top sentimentality"], ["JJ NN IN NN", "passionate message about forgiveness"], ["JJ NN IN NN", "third act, in particular,"], ["JJ NN WDT VBZ", "bizarre amalgam that doesn't"], ["JJ NN CC JJ", "uneven tone and lackluster"], ["DT NN IN NN", "a layer of whimsy"], ["JJ NN CC NN", "over-the-top sentimentality and lack"], ["NN VBZ DT JJ", "*CJ7*, is a family-friendly"], ["NN VBZ DT JJ", "*CJ7* is a hyperactive,"], ["DT NN VBZ VBN", "The film has received"], ["NN IN PRP$ NN", "territory with its focus"], ["NN CC NN IN", "sentimentality and lack of"], ["NN CC NN IN", "heart and charm, while"], ["NN IN NNP NNP", "presence of Xu Jiao,"], ["NN VBZ DT NN", "gender, keeps the audience"], ["VBZ VBN IN PRP$", "is criticized for its"], ["NN IN NN CC", "message about forgiveness and"], ["NN IN DT NNS", "reviews, with some critics"], ["NN IN NN NN", "focus on family life"], ["JJ NN CC DT", "young viewers, but the"], ["IN NN CC NN", "of life and death."], ["NNS IN JJ NN", "ventures into new territory"], ["NN CC DT JJ", "viewers, but the film's"], ["NNP CC NNP NNP", "Hustle* and *Shaolin Soccer*."], ["NNS IN DT JJ", "results in a bizarre"], ["VBZ DT NN NN", "keeps the audience engaged."], ["NNP NNP CC NNP", "Slapstick, Sentimentality, and Surrealism**"], ["NNP NNP CC NNP", "Fu Hustle* and *Shaolin"], ["VBN IN PRP$ JJ", "criticized for its over-the-top"], ["JJ NN IN PRP$", "new territory with its"], ["IN JJ NN IN", "into new territory with"], ["IN JJ NN IN", "with winsome charm without"], ["DT JJ NN WDT", "a bizarre amalgam that"], ["JJ NN CC JJ NN", "uneven tone and lackluster story."], ["VBZ DT JJ NN IN", "is a family-friendly comedy that"], ["NN VBZ DT JJ NN", "*CJ7*, is a family-friendly comedy"], ["NNP NNP CC NNP NNP", "Fu Hustle* and *Shaolin Soccer*."], ["NN VBZ VBN IN PRP$", "particular, is criticized for its"], ["DT JJ NN WDT VBZ", "a bizarre amalgam that doesn't"], ["VBN IN PRP$ JJ NN", "criticized for its over-the-top sentimentality"], ["NNS IN DT JJ NN", "results in a bizarre amalgam"], ["VBZ VBN IN PRP$ JJ", "is criticized for its over-the-top"], ["IN NNP NNP CC NNP", "of Slapstick, Sentimentality, and Surrealism**"], ["JJ NN IN DT NNS", "mixed reviews, with some critics"], ["JJ NN CC DT JJ", "young viewers, but the film's"], ["DT JJ JJ NN IN", "The film's third act, in"], ["JJ NN CC NN IN", "over-the-top sentimentality and lack of"], ["VBZ VBN IN PRP$ JJ NN", "is criticized for its over-the-top sentimentality"], ["NN VBZ VBN IN PRP$ JJ", "particular, is criticized for its over-the-top"], ["NN VBZ DT JJ NN IN", "*CJ7*, is a family-friendly comedy that"], ["JJ NNS IN DT JJ NN", "edginess results in a bizarre amalgam"], ["NN VBZ VBN IN PRP$ JJ NN", "particular, is criticized for its over-the-top sentimentality"]]}

Despite its intriguing setting, the film fails to deliver a captivating experience. The plot revolves around a murder mystery at a scientific research base, but the storyline is marred by predictable twists and a lack of genuine suspense. Kate Beckinsale stars as the lead, but her performance, though commendable, is overshadowed by the film's overall shortcomings.\n\nCritics have panned the movie for its spoon-fed exposition, lackluster performances, and a by-the-numbers approach to storytelling. The action sequences, set against blizzard-like conditions, are described as chaotic and poorly staged, often likened to watching people fight inside a snow globe. The film's attempt at creating tension and paranoia falls flat, leaving the audience disengaged.\n\nThe dialogue is criticized for being overly explanatory, with characters constantly narrating the obvious, which detracts from any potential suspense. The film's climax is particularly disappointing, with a twist that is telegraphed well in advance, making the resolution feel anticlimactic and unsatisfying.\n\nDespite its slick and expensive look, \"Whiteout\" is deemed a \"severely nonthrilling thriller\" that moves at a glacial pace.

{"original_summary": "Frost/Nixon is weighty and eloquent; a cross between a boxing match and a ballet with Oscar worthy performances.", "generated_summary": "\"Frost/Nixon,\" directed by Ron Howard, is a political thriller that has garnered significant acclaim for its compelling narrative and powerful performances. The film, adapted from Peter Morgan's play, dramatizes the historic 1977 television interviews between British talk-show host David Frost and former U.S. President Richard Nixon. \n\nHoward, known for his resourceful direction, allows the script to shine while providing a brisk and engaging pace. The film is often compared to a gladiatorial event or a boxing match, with Frost and Nixon each viewing the interviews as their moment of glory. The screenplay by Morgan is praised for its density, complexity, and entertainment value, making the film more thrilling than Howard's previous work, \"The Da Vinci Code.\"\n\nThe performances of Frank Langella as Nixon and Michael Sheen as Frost are particularly lauded. Langella's portrayal of Nixon is described as magnetic and deeply immersive, earning him significant praise and making him a strong contender for awards. Sheen's performance is also noted for its effectiveness, contributing to the film's dynamic portrayal of the two contrasting personalities.\n\nWhile some critics feel the film doesn't entirely escape its stage origins and may seem overly dramatized, the general consensus is that \"Frost/Nixon\" is a gripping and entertaining film. It offers a fascinating look at the intersection of politics and television, capturing the tension and drama of the interviews. The film is recommended for political junkies, history buffs, and anyone interested in the complexities of power and media.\n\nOverall, \"Frost/Nixon\" is celebrated for its smart direction, strong

{"original_summary": "Undeniably gripping, Bronson forces the viewer to make some hard decisions about where the line between art and exploitation lies.", "generated_summary": "\"Bronson\" is a film that delves into the life of Britain's most notorious prisoner, Michael Peterson, who adopts the persona of Charles Bronson. Directed by Nicolas Winding Refn, the movie is a visceral and theatrical portrayal of a man whose life is marked by extreme violence and a craving for fame. Tom Hardy delivers an extraordinary performance, fully immersing himself in the role and bringing a ferocious energy to the character.\n\nThe film is often compared to Stanley Kubrick's \"A Clockwork Orange\" for its blend of ultraviolence and artistic flair, but it lacks the political undertones of Kubrick's work. Refn employs slow-motion sequences and classical music to heighten the impact of the brutality, creating a surreal and unsettling atmosphere. The narrative is punctuated by scenes where Bronson, in clown makeup, addresses an imaginary audience, adding a layer of theatricality and surrealism.\n\nWhile Hardy's performance is universally praised, the film itself receives mixed reviews. Some critics find it original and pacy, appreciating its unique approach and Hardy's magnetic presence.

The movie attempts to evoke the same eerie atmosphere as Hitchcock's \"The Birds\" but falls short in delivering genuine scares or a coherent plot.

The performances by Mark Wahlberg and Zooey Deschanel are noted for their quiet dignity, but they are ultimately undermined by preposterous scenes and dialogue.\n\nThe film's premise, which revolves around an unexplained natural phenomenon causing mass suicides, is seen as absurdly preachy and illogical.

The film, based on Kristin Hahn's script, features a protagonist named Will who is given sassy lines and emotional moments, though her character lacks a deeply complex inner life. The movie addresses themes of acceptance and tolerance, wrapped in a familiar, polished package. While some critics find it preachy and tiresome, others appreciate its heart and charm, likening it to the spirit of Dolly Parton.\n\nThe film is noted for its generous and openhearted nature, presenting a kinder, gentler world. It avoids using a conventionally pretty protagonist to critique beauty standards, instead offering a more imaginative and expansive view of beauty. Jennifer Aniston's nuanced performance as Rosie and the natural chemistry between Danielle MacDonald and Odeya Rush are highlights.\n\nDirector Anne Fletcher aims to evoke strong emotions, though some feel the message is delivered with excessive sentimentality.

{"original_summary": "Despite strong performances from Bryan Cranston and Alice Eve, Cold Comes the Night is undone by a series of illogical plot twists.", "generated_summary": "\"Cold Comes the Night\" is a low-budget thriller that delivers a mixed bag of experiences. The film features strong lead performances by Bryan Cranston and Alice Eve, who play unlikely partners in crime. Cranston's portrayal, though occasionally goofy, and Eve's strikingly direct and affecting performance are highlights. The movie is set in a downscale motel in upstate New York, a location that adds to its cold, neo-noir atmosphere.\n\nDespite some well-played action scenes and neat twists, the film struggles with its own ridiculousness and illogical plot points. The suspense is intermittent, and the thrills are few and far between. The movie's pulpy scenario is treated with a certain sophistication by director Tze Chun, but it ultimately fails to elevate itself to the level of classics like \"Fargo\" or \"A Simple Plan.\"\n\nWhile \"Cold Comes the Night\" may not be worth a special trip to the theater, it can serve as a sturdy, at-home viewing option on a wintry night.

{"original_summary": "Beauty only goes skin deep in this shallow but visually stunning film.", "generated_summary": "\"Mission to Mars,\" directed by Brian De Palma, is a sci-fi adventure film that has garnered a mixed to negative reception. Critics have pointed out that the movie lacks real suspense and is blandly directed, with De Palma's touch failing at crucial moments. The film is described as cold and distant, much like the Red Planet itself, and it fails to bring the wit or emotional depth seen in other space exploration movies. The alien encounters in the film are considered embarrassing, and the filmmaker is criticized for being shallow in the face of profound questions.\n\nWhile the special effects, set design, and cinematography are praised for offsetting the weak story, the movie is still seen as risibly bad on many levels. Some reviewers note that it offers an enjoyable tour of Mars with some thrills and sharp computer effects, but it is shockingly slack in tension for an adventure film. Despite being old-fashioned and corny, it does have a few nail-biter moments.\n\nOverall, \"Mission to Mars\" is seen as a waste of money and talent, with a lackluster and unoriginal script. It coarsens the cosmic consciousness of \"2001: A Space Odyssey\" with product placement and fails to figure out its aesthetic direction. While visually inspiring at times, the film is ultimately considered mind-bogglingly stupid and an embarrassment for all involved.", "matched_patterns": [["DT JJ NN IN", "the cosmic consciousness of"], ["DT JJ NN IN", "an enjoyable tour of"], ["IN DT JJ NN", "While the special effects,"], ["NN IN DT NN", "embarrassment for all involved."], ["NN IN DT NN", "tension for an adventure"], ["NN IN DT NN", "talent, with a lackluster"], ["NN CC JJ NN", "lackluster and unoriginal script."], ["NN CC JJ NN", "wit or emotional depth"], ["VBZ DT JJ NN", "coarsens the cosmic consciousness"], ["VBZ DT JJ NN", "is a sci-fi adventure"], ["VBZ DT JJ NN", "offers an enjoyable tour"], ["NN DT NN VBZ", "story, the movie is"], ["JJ NN DT NN", "weak story, the movie"], ["NN VBZ VBN IN", "filmmaker is criticized for"], ["NN VBZ VBN IN", "film is described as"], ["NN IN JJ NN", "failing at crucial moments."], ["DT JJ JJ NN", "a few nail-biter moments."], ["IN DT NN IN", "in the face of"], ["IN DT NN IN", "as a waste of"], ["NNP NNP VBZ DT", "De Palma, is a"], ["VBN IN NNP NNP", "directed by Brian De"], ["DT NN IN DT", "an embarrassment for all"], ["NNP VBZ DT JJ", "Palma, is a sci-fi"], ["IN DT NN NN", "for an adventure film."], ["JJ NN IN JJ", "touch failing at crucial"], ["DT NN IN NN", "the face of profound"], ["DT NN IN NN", "a waste of money"], ["DT JJ NN NN", "a sci-fi adventure film"], ["DT NN VBZ VBN", "the filmmaker is criticized"], ["DT NN VBZ VBN", "The film is described"], ["NN CC NN IN", "money and talent, with"], ["NN IN NNP NNP", "consciousness of \"2001: A"], ["TO VB DT NN", "to bring the wit"], ["VBZ VBN IN DT", "is seen as a"], ["NN IN NN CC", "waste of money and"], ["VBG DT JJ NN", "offsetting the weak story,"], ["NN IN NN NN", "face of profound questions."], ["IN NN CC NN", "of money and talent,"], ["NNP NNP NNP NNP", "\"2001: A Space Odyssey\""], ["NNP VBZ VBN IN", "Mars\" is seen as"], ["NNS IN DT NN", "encounters in the film"], ["JJ NN IN NNP", "cosmic consciousness of \"2001:"], ["JJ NN IN NNP", "enjoyable tour of Mars"], ["VBN IN DT NN", "seen as a waste"], ["DT JJ NN DT", "the weak story, the"], ["NNP NNP NNP VBZ", "Brian De Palma, is"], ["IN JJ NN NN", "in other space exploration"], ["IN DT NN VBZ", "that the movie lacks"], ["DT NN VBZ VBN IN", "The film is described as"], ["DT NN VBZ VBN IN", "the filmmaker is criticized for"], ["JJ NN DT NN VBZ", "weak story, the movie is"], ["VBZ DT JJ NN IN", "coarsens the cosmic consciousness of"], ["VBZ DT JJ NN IN", "offers an enjoyable tour of"], ["NNP VBZ DT JJ NN", "Palma, is a sci-fi adventure"], ["NNP NNP VBZ DT JJ", "De Palma, is a sci-fi"], ["JJ NN IN JJ NN", "touch failing at crucial moments."], ["DT NN IN DT NN", "an embarrassment for all involved."], ["NN IN DT NN NN", "tension for an adventure film."], ["DT NN CC JJ NN", "the wit or emotional depth"], ["DT NN CC JJ NN", "a lackluster and unoriginal script."], ["NN IN NN CC NN", "waste of money and talent,"], ["DT JJ NN IN NNP", "an enjoyable tour of Mars"], ["DT JJ NN IN NNP", "the cosmic consciousness of \"2001:"], ["NNP VBN IN NNP NNP", "Mars,\" directed by Brian De"], ["IN DT NN IN NN", "in the face of profound"], ["IN DT NN IN NN", "as a waste of money"], ["JJ NN NN WDT VBZ", "sci-fi adventure film that has"], ["NN CC NN IN DT", "money and talent, with a"], ["VBZ VBN IN DT NN", "is seen as a waste"], ["DT NN IN NN CC", "a waste of money and"], ["PRP VBZ DT JJ NN", "It coarsens the cosmic consciousness"], ["PRP VBZ DT JJ NN", "it offers an enjoyable tour"], ["NNP NNP VBZ DT JJ NN", "De Palma, is a sci-fi adventure"], ["DT JJ NN IN NNP NNP", "the cosmic consciousness of \"2001: A"], ["NNP VBZ DT JJ NN NN", "Palma, is a sci-fi adventure film"], ["NNP NNP NNP VBZ DT JJ", "Brian De Palma, is a sci-fi"], ["IN DT NN IN NN CC", "as a waste of money and"], ["DT NN IN NN CC NN", "a waste of money and talent,"], ["NN VBZ VBN IN VBG JJ", "filmmaker is criticized for being shallow"], ["DT NN VBZ VBN IN JJ", "The film is described as cold"], ["NN CC NN IN DT NN", "money and talent, with a lackluster"]]}
