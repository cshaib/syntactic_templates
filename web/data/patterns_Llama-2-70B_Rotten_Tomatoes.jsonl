The movie tells the story of the famous interviews between Richard Nixon and David Frost, which took place in 1977. Frank Langella and Michael Sheen, who originated the roles in the play, reprise their performances in the film.\n\nThe movie has been praised for its gripping and entertaining portrayal of the interviews, which are presented as a battle of wits between Nixon and Frost.

The film also raises interesting questions about the nature of power and the role of the media in shaping public opinion.\n\nSome critics have noted that the movie feels a bit stagey, but most agree that it is a minor flaw in an otherwise excellent film.

The movie follows a hitman (played by Nicolas Cage) who takes on one last job in Bangkok, but things don't go as planned. The film has some stylish moments and a few well-executed action scenes, but it's ultimately let down by a dull and predictable plot, underdeveloped characters, and a lack of originality.\n\nMany critics have pointed out that the film's storyline is overly familiar and cliched, with a protagonist who is a lone-wolf hitman struggling with his conscience on his final job. The film's pacing is also criticized for being slow and plodding, with some scenes feeling unnecessary or dragged out.\n\nDespite the negative reviews, some critics have praised the film's visuals, with the Pang brothers using their Hollywood budget to create some striking images of Bangkok's skyscrapers at night. The film's cast is also commended for their performances, with Cage being praised for his portrayal of the brooding hitman.\n\nOverall, Bangkok Dangerous is a disappointing film that fails to bring anything new or interesting to the table. It's a rehashing of familiar tropes and cliches, with a dull plot and underdeveloped characters.

The film follows the story of a housewife, Tara, who is struggling to find meaning and purpose in her life, and her husband, Mark, who is trying to hold onto their marriage. The film features strong performances from its two leads, Gemma Arterton and Dominic Savage, and is described as a \"wrenching\" and \"harrowing\" experience.\n\nThe film's title may imply an action-packed plot, but it is actually a slow-burning, emotionally charged drama that explores the complexities of marriage and the struggles of finding one's identity.

{"original_summary": "Naturalistic but evocative, Last Tango in Paris is a vivid exploration of pain, love, and sex featuring a typically towering Marlon Brando performance.", "generated_summary": "  \"Last Tango in Paris\" is a controversial drama film directed by Bernardo Bertolucci, released in 1972. The film explores themes of love, grief, and sexual passion in a dark and torrid manner, featuring a remarkable performance by Marlon Brando. The film's style is operatic and extravagant, with eccentric camera moves and a vaguely naturalistic tone. Brando's improvisational performance is intuitive, rapt, and princely, achieving realism with the terror of actual experience still alive on the screen. The film is both sad and hilarious at times, with an evocative look, feel, and sound.

The film has received mixed reviews from critics, with some praising its boldness, originality, and entertainment value, while others have criticized its excessive violence, length, and handling of historical themes.\n\nSome reviewers have noted that the film's use of violence and racist language can be both powerful and problematic, with some finding it effective in conveying the horrors of slavery and others feeling that it is exploitative and gratuitous. The film's pacing and structure have also been criticized, with some finding it meandering and overly long.\n\nDespite these criticisms, many reviewers have praised the film's performances, particularly those of Foxx and Waltz, who won an Academy Award for his role.

The film has been described as a \"bloodbath\" and \"harrowing\" but also \"humane\" and \"poetic.\" Some critics have noted that the director's talent is evident, but the film does not rise to his level of ability. The film has been called \"brutally nihilistic\" and \"one of the best Korean films\" to have been released in a long time, but also criticized for being \"ultra-cool\" and lacking a larger purpose beyond its violence. Overall, the film seems to be a polarizing experience for viewers, with some finding it to be a well-crafted and impactful revenge thriller, while others find it to be excessive and lacking in substance.", "matched_patterns": [["IN DT JJ NN", "in a long time,"], ["VBZ DT JJ NN", "is a violent revenge"], ["DT JJ NN IN", "a polarizing experience for"], ["DT NN VBZ VBN", "The film has been"], ["NN CC JJ NN", "direction and dark humor,"], ["NNP VBZ DT JJ", "Vengeance is a violent"], ["JJ CC JJ NN", "well-crafted and impactful revenge"], ["DT JJ NN NN", "a violent revenge thriller"], ["NNP NNP VBZ DT", "Mr. Vengeance is a"], ["DT JJ CC JJ", "a well-crafted and impactful"], ["CC JJ NN IN", "and dark humor, while"], ["DT JJ NN CC", "a long time, but"], ["IN DT NN NN", "that the director's talent"], ["NN IN NNP NNP", "Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance"], ["CC NN IN DT", "and \"one of the"], ["VBZ VBN VBN IN", "has been described as"], ["IN NN CC NN", "in coherence and credibility."], ["VBN IN DT NN", "described as a \"bloodbath\""], ["VBN IN DT NN", "noted that the director's"], ["DT NNS VBP VBN", "Some critics have noted"], ["IN DT NN CC", "as a \"bloodbath\" and"], ["IN DT NN VBZ", "Overall, the film seems"], ["TO VB DT NN", "to be a polarizing"], ["VBN IN DT JJ", "released in a long"], ["TO VB DT JJ", "to be a polarizing"], ["TO VB DT JJ", "to be a well-crafted"], ["JJ NN IN NN", "polarizing experience for viewers,"], ["NN NN WDT VBZ", "revenge thriller that has"], ["JJ NNS IN NN", "mixed reviews from critics."], ["NNS VBP VBN IN", "critics have noted that"], ["IN NN IN DT", "for viewers, with some"], ["IN NNS VBP VBN", "while others have found"], ["NNP VBZ DT JJ NN", "Vengeance is a violent revenge"], ["DT JJ CC JJ NN", "a well-crafted and impactful revenge"], ["NNP NNP VBZ DT JJ", "Mr. Vengeance is a violent"], ["NN CC JJ NN IN", "direction and dark humor, while"], ["IN DT JJ NN CC", "in a long time, but"], ["VBZ DT JJ NN NN", "is a violent revenge thriller"], ["VBN IN DT JJ NN", "released in a long time,"], ["DT JJ NN IN NN", "a polarizing experience for viewers,"], ["NN VBZ VBN VBN IN", "film has been described as"], ["DT NN VBZ VBN VBN", "The film has been called"], ["DT NN VBZ VBN VBN", "The film has been described"], ["JJ NN NN WDT VBZ", "violent revenge thriller that has"], ["JJ NN CC JJ NN", "stylish direction and dark humor,"], ["DT JJ NN NN WDT", "a violent revenge thriller that"], ["NN IN NNS VBP VBN", "humor, while others have found"], ["NNP NNP VBZ DT JJ NN", "Mr. Vengeance is a violent revenge"], ["NNP VBZ DT JJ NN NN", "Vengeance is a violent revenge thriller"], ["DT NN VBZ VBN VBN IN", "The film has been described as"], ["VBZ DT JJ NN NN WDT", "is a violent revenge thriller that"], ["DT JJ NN NN WDT VBZ", "a violent revenge thriller that has"], ["NNS VBP VBN IN DT NN", "critics have noted that the director's"], ["TO VB DT JJ CC JJ", "to be a well-crafted and impactful"], ["TO VB DT JJ NN IN", "to be a polarizing experience for"], ["VBZ VBN VBN IN DT NN", "has been described as a \"bloodbath\""], ["VBZ DT JJ NN NN WDT VBZ", "is a violent revenge thriller that has"], ["NNP VBZ DT JJ NN NN WDT", "Vengeance is a violent revenge thriller that"], ["NNP NNP VBZ DT JJ NN NN", "Mr. Vengeance is a violent revenge thriller"], ["DT NNS VBP VBN IN DT NN", "Some critics have noted that the director's"], ["TO VB DT JJ CC JJ NN", "to be a well-crafted and impactful revenge"], ["NNP VBZ DT JJ NN NN WDT VBZ", "Vengeance is a violent revenge thriller that has"]]}
