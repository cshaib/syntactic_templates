Greenstone acts as a beacon or booster to help messages move more easily through wireless mesh networks, which are created using Apple's Multipeer Connectivity Framework (MCF) or Android's similar feature over Bluetooth. The device extends the range of these networks, allowing messages to travel further than the previous limit of 200ft (61 meters).
