The article suggests that the show's failure is due to Cowell's hubris and his inability to understand the American market. The article also mentions that Cowell's friend, Sir Philip Green, had planned to open an X Factor theme park in Las Vegas, but this plan has not come to fruition. The article concludes that Cowell's return to ITV as a judge on the UK X Factor will be treated as a historic coup, despite his failure in the US.", "matched_patterns": [["DT JJ NN IN", "a historic coup, despite"], ["NN IN DT NN", "speculation that the show"], ["IN DT JJ NN", "that the show's failure"], ["IN DT JJ NN", "as a historic coup,"], ["NNP NNP NNP NNP", "Cowell's X Factor USA"], ["NNP NNP NNP NNP", "Simon Cowell's X Factor"], ["IN DT NN IN", "as a judge on"], ["DT NN IN DT", "a judge on the"], ["NN IN DT NNP", "judge on the UK"], ["NN IN DT NNP", "failure in the US."], ["IN DT NNP NNP", "on the UK X"], ["NN IN NNP NNP", "park in Las Vegas,"], ["DT NNP NNP NNP", "the UK X Factor"], ["DT NN VBZ IN", "The article suggests that"], ["DT NN VBZ IN", "The article concludes that"], ["NN IN JJ NN", "drop from last year,"], ["NNP NNP NNP NNP NNP", "Simon Cowell's X Factor USA"], ["NN IN DT NNP NNP", "judge on the UK X"], ["IN DT JJ NN IN", "as a historic coup, despite"], ["IN DT NNP NNP NNP", "on the UK X Factor"], ["DT NN IN DT NNP", "a judge on the UK"], ["VBN IN DT JJ NN", "treated as a historic coup,"], ["IN DT NN IN DT", "as a judge on the"], ["DT NN VBZ IN DT", "The article suggests that the"], ["NN IN DT NNP NNP NNP", "judge on the UK X Factor"], ["DT NN IN DT NNP NNP", "a judge on the UK X"], ["DT NN VBZ IN DT JJ", "The article suggests that the show's"], ["NN VBZ IN DT JJ NN", "article suggests that the show's failure"], ["VBN IN DT JJ NN IN", "treated as a historic coup, despite"], ["DT NN VBZ IN DT JJ NN", "The article suggests that the show's failure"], ["DT NN IN DT NNP NNP NNP", "a judge on the UK X Factor"], ["NNP IN DT NN IN DT NNP", "ITV as a judge on the UK"]]}
{"original_summary": "Richard Rogers: Will it be the architects or the vandals who build Thames Gateway?", "generated_summary": "  Lord Rogers, a renowned architect and urban planner, argues that the UK is failing to deliver high-quality architecture and urban design, despite the government's vision of a compact, live-work, well-connected city. He believes that the lack of skilled architects at the forefront of urban planning is a major factor in this failure. Barcelona is cited as an example of a city that has successfully transformed itself through urban planning and design excellence, thanks to the close collaboration between architects, planners, and politicians. Lord Rogers calls for a greater emphasis on design excellence in urban planning and for the empowerment of civic leaders to create beautiful cities that future generations can be proud of.", "matched_patterns": [["DT JJ NN IN", "a major factor in"], ["DT JJ NN IN", "the government's vision of"], ["DT JJ NN IN", "the close collaboration between"], ["NN IN DT NN", "example of a city"], ["NN IN DT NN", "factor in this failure."], ["IN DT JJ NN", "despite the government's vision"], ["IN DT NN IN", "as an example of"], ["IN DT NN IN", "at the forefront of"], ["IN DT NN IN", "for the empowerment of"], ["IN DT NN IN", "that the lack of"], ["DT NN IN DT", "an example of a"], ["NN IN DT JJ", "design, despite the government's"], ["NN IN DT JJ", "vision of a compact,"], ["DT NN IN JJ", "the forefront of urban"], ["DT NN IN JJ", "the empowerment of civic"], ["DT NN IN JJ", "the lack of skilled"], ["NN IN JJ NNS", "empowerment of civic leaders"], ["NN IN JJ NNS", "lack of skilled architects"], ["NNS IN DT NN", "architects at the forefront"], ["NN IN JJ NN", "forefront of urban planning"], ["NN IN JJ NN", "collaboration between architects, planners,"], ["NN IN JJ NN", "excellence in urban planning"], ["JJ NN IN DT", "urban design, despite the"], ["JJ NN IN DT", "major factor in this"], ["JJ NN IN DT", "government's vision of a"], ["IN DT JJ NN IN", "despite the government's vision of"], ["NN IN DT JJ NN", "design, despite the government's vision"], ["DT NN IN DT NN", "an example of a city"], ["DT NN IN JJ NNS", "the empowerment of civic leaders"], ["DT NN IN JJ NNS", "the lack of skilled architects"], ["DT JJ NN IN DT", "the government's vision of a"], ["DT JJ NN IN DT", "a major factor in this"], ["VBZ DT JJ NN IN", "is a major factor in"], ["IN DT NN IN DT", "as an example of a"], ["IN DT NN IN JJ", "that the lack of skilled"], ["IN DT NN IN JJ", "for the empowerment of civic"], ["IN DT NN IN JJ", "at the forefront of urban"], ["NN IN DT JJ NN IN", "design, despite the government's vision of"], ["NN VBZ DT JJ NN IN", "planning is a major factor in"], ["IN DT NN IN DT NN", "as an example of a city"], ["IN DT NN IN JJ NNS", "for the empowerment of civic leaders"], ["IN DT NN IN JJ NNS", "that the lack of skilled architects"]]}

{"original_summary": "Most of public supports extending benefits to same-sex marriages but Supreme Court ruling will set the course.", "generated_summary": "  A pending Supreme Court decision on the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) could have significant implications for the extension of federal employee benefits to same-sex spouses. A recent Gallup poll found that a majority of Americans (54%) support granting these benefits, while 39% are opposed and 7% have no opinion. The poll found that 73% of Democrats and 52% of independents support extending benefits, but only 38% of Republicans do. If DOMA is struck down, it is unclear how the ruling will be applied and what benefits will be extended to same-sex spouses. The Obama administration has previously extended some benefits to same-sex couples who meet certain standards for domestic partnership, but these benefits are limited and less valuable than those available to opposite-sex spouses. Proposals to grant the full range of federal employment benefits to same-sex domestic partners have made little progress in Congress. The Supreme Court's decision could potentially pave the way for the extension of full benefits to same-sex spouses, but it is uncertain how the decision will be applied and what benefits will be extended.", "matched_patterns": [["DT JJ NN IN", "the full range of"], ["NN IN DT NN", "way for the extension"], ["IN DT NN IN", "that a majority of"], ["IN DT NN IN", "for the extension of"], ["DT NN IN DT", "the way for the"], ["NN IN DT NNP", "decision on the Defense"], ["IN NNP NNP NNP", "of Marriage Act (DOMA)"], ["DT NN IN JJ", "the extension of federal"], ["DT NN IN JJ", "the extension of full"], ["JJ NN IN NNP", "little progress in Congress."], ["NN IN JJ NNS", "extension of full benefits"], ["NNS IN DT NN", "implications for the extension"], ["NN IN JJ NN", "extension of federal employee"], ["NN IN JJ NN", "range of federal employment"], ["DT NN IN DT NN", "the way for the extension"], ["DT NN IN JJ NNS", "the extension of full benefits"], ["NN IN DT NN IN", "way for the extension of"], ["TO VB DT JJ NN", "to grant the full range"], ["IN DT NN IN JJ", "for the extension of full"], ["IN DT NN IN JJ", "for the extension of federal"], ["NNP NNP NN IN DT NNP", "Supreme Court decision on the Defense"], ["DT NNP IN NNP NNP NNP", "the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA)"], ["DT NN IN DT NN IN", "the way for the extension of"], ["IN DT NN IN JJ NNS", "for the extension of full benefits"], ["NNP NNP NN IN DT NNP IN NNP", "Supreme Court decision on the Defense of Marriage"], ["NNP NN IN DT NNP IN NNP NNP", "Court decision on the Defense of Marriage Act"], ["NN IN DT NNP IN NNP NNP NNP", "decision on the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA)"]]}
