{"original_summary": "Prior to the current update it appeared there was some evidence that cranberry juice may decrease the number of symptomatic UTIs over a 12 month period, particularly for women with recurrent UTIs. The addition of 14 further studies suggests that cranberry juice is less effective than previously indicated. Although some of small studies demonstrated a small benefit for women with recurrent UTIs, there were no statistically significant differences when the results of a much larger study were included. Cranberry products were not significantly different to antibiotics for preventing UTIs in three small studies. Given the large number of dropouts/withdrawals from studies (mainly attributed to the acceptability of consuming cranberry products particularly juice, over long periods), and the evidence that the benefit for preventing UTI is small, cranberry juice cannot currently be recommended for the prevention of UTIs. Other preparations (such as powders) need to be quantified using standardised methods to ensure the potency, and contain enough of the 'active' ingredient, before being evaluated in clinical studies or recommended for use.", "generated_summary": "OOM", "matched_patterns": []}

It also improved RDQ scores, SF-MPQ scores, and SF-36 scores, and the cumulative incidence of discontinuation due to insufficient pain relief was significantly lower for tramadol/APAP than for placebo.\n\nThe second study evaluated the efficacy and safety of tramadol in the treatment of chronic low back pain. The study found that tramadol was effective in reducing pain and improving physical functioning and quality of life. The most common adverse events were nausea, dizziness, and constipation.\n\nThe third study compared the long-term safety and efficacy of chronic opioid therapy in a randomized trial of patients with back pain. The study found that opioid therapy had a positive effect on pain and mood but little effect on activity and sleep. The study also found that opioid therapy for chronic back pain was used without significant risk of abuse.\n\nOverall, the article suggests that tramadol is a safe and effective treatment option for chronic lower back pain, with a tolerable side effect profile and a low risk of abuse. The studies also suggest that opioid therapy can be effective in reducing pain and improving quality of life, but the long-term benefits are limited, and tapering off opioid treatment is recommended.", "matched_patterns": [["NN IN JJ NN", "safety of tramadol/APAP combination"], ["IN DT JJ NN", "with a different approach"], ["IN DT JJ NN", "in a randomized trial"], ["IN DT JJ NN",

{"original_summary": "In patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis whose disease is refractory to conventional treatment using corticosteroids and/or immunosuppressive agents, infliximab is effective in inducing clinical remission, inducing clinical response, promoting mucosal healing, and reducing the need for colectomy at least in the short term. Serious adverse events attributable to infliximab were not common in the included studies but physicians should be aware of and be prepared to deal with potential adverse events such as anaphylactic reactions and infections.", "generated_summary": "  Infliximab, a chimeric monoclonal antibody directed against tumor necrosis factor alpha, has been shown to be effective in the treatment of Crohn's disease, but its efficacy in ulcerative colitis has been less established. Several studies have investigated the use of infliximab in ulcerative colitis, with varying results.\n\nOne study found that infliximab was effective in inducing and maintaining remission in patients with moderate-to-severe active ulcerative colitis, with 69% of patients who received 5 mg of infliximab and 61% of those who received 10 mg achieving a clinical response at week 8, compared to 37% of those who received placebo. In another study, infliximab was found to be effective in the management of steroid-dependent ulcerative colitis, with 10 out of 20 patients achieving remission after the first infusion and maintaining it at a minimal steroid dosage without any relapse at 9.7+/-1.0 months follow-up.\n\nHowever, not all studies have shown positive results. One study found that infliximab did not support the use of infliximab in the management of moderately active glucocorticoid-resistant ulcerative colitis, as there was no statistically significant difference between the infliximab and placebo groups in the proportion of patients with a Baron score of 0 or UCSS < or =2. Another study found that infliximab was well tolerated and may provide clinical benefit for some patients with steroid-refractory ulcerative colitis, but the study was terminated prematurely due to slow enrollment.\n\nOverall, the evidence suggests that infliximab may be effective in the treatment of ulcerative colitis, particularly in patients with moderate-to-severe active disease who have not responded to conventional treatment.

The trial found that CT was more sensitive than other measures of emphysema progression, and changes in CT and forced expiratory volume in 1 s were correlated. All methods of densitometric analysis showed a trend suggestive of treatment benefit, with p-values ranging from 0.049 to 0.084. Exacerbation frequency was unaltered by treatment, but a reduction in exacerbation severity was observed. The study concludes that CT is a more sensitive outcome measure of emphysema-modifying therapy than physiology and health status, and demonstrates a trend of treatment benefit from alpha(1)-AT augmentation.\n\nIn addition, a double-blind trial of alpha(1)-antitrypsin augmentation therapy was conducted on 26 Danish and 30 Dutch ex-smokers with alpha(1)-antitrypsin deficiency. The trial found that lung density measurements by CT may facilitate future randomized clinical trials of investigational drugs for a disease in which little progress in therapy has been made in the past 30 years.

{"original_summary": "The use of ergometrine-oxytocin as part of the routine active management of the third stage of labour appears to be associated with a small but statistically significant reduction in the risk of PPH when compared to oxytocin for blood loss of 500 ml or more. No statistically significant difference was observed between the groups for blood loss of 1000 ml or more. A statistically significant difference was observed in the presence of maternal side-effects, including elevation of diastolic blood pressure, vomiting and nausea, associated with ergometrine-oxytocin use compared to oxytocin use. Thus, the advantage of a reduction in the risk of PPH, between 500 and 1000 ml blood loss, needs to be weighed against the adverse side-effects associated with the use of ergometrine-oxytocin.", "generated_summary": "  The four studies compared the use of oxytocin and Syntometrine (a combination of oxytocin and ergometrine) in the management of the third stage of labor. The studies found that:\n\n* Oxytocin and Syntometrine were equally effective in preventing postpartum hemorrhage, but Syntometrine was associated with a higher incidence of nausea, vomiting, and hypertension.\n* Oxytocin alone was as effective as Syntometrine in preventing postpartum hemorrhage, and was associated with a lower incidence of nausea, vomiting, and hypertension.\n* Oxytocin plus ergometrine was more effective than oxytocin alone in preventing postpartum hemorrhage, but the ergometrine component was associated with side effects such as nausea, vomiting, and raised blood pressure.\n* Intramuscular Syntometrine was more effective than Syntocinon (oxytocin) in reducing blood loss and the risk of postpartum hemorrhage, but was associated with a higher incidence of manual removal of the placenta.\n\nOverall, the studies suggest that oxytocin alone may be a better choice than Syntometrine for the management of the third stage of labor, as it is associated with fewer side effects and is equally effective in preventing postpartum hemorrhage.

The study also found that 3-year overall survival was higher in the radiotherapy plus hyperthermia group than in the radiotherapy-alone group.\n\nThe study also looked at the effectiveness of local hyperthermia in 56 patients with locally advanced rectal cancer. The results showed that thermoradiotherapy increased the 5-year survival rate of patients to 35.6% compared to 6.6% in the control group.\n\nAnother study examined the effectiveness of deep-seated tumors in the lung, stomach, pancreas, liver, bladder, and rectum treated with radiotherapy plus hyperthermia. The results showed that complete response and partial response were obtained in 80% of lung cancer cases, 39% of stomach cancer cases, 56% of liver cancer cases, 35% of pancreas cancer cases, 71% of bladder cancer cases, 100% of primary rectal cancer cases, and 47% of recurrent rectal cancer cases.\n\nA prospective randomized study compared 434 MHz microwave therapy combined with external beam radiotherapy (VHF + RT) with standard external beam radiotherapy (RT) in treating locally recurrent or inoperable primary adenocarcinoma of the rectum. The results showed that VHF + RT produced no therapeutic advantage over conventional radiation therapy alone.\n\nFinally, a study looked at the long-term results of 122 patients with advanced rectal cancer treated with three different methods. The results showed that patients treated with endocavitary 915 MHz microwave applicators combined with radiation had a higher 5-year survival rate than those treated with preoperative radiation or surgery alone.\n\nOverall, these studies suggest that hyperthermia in addition to radiotherapy may be especially useful in locally advanced cervical tumors and may offer a survival advantage for patients treated with preoperative radiation combined with endocavitary hyperthermia. However, the study also found that VHF microwave therapy in conjunction with radiotherapy produces no therapeutic advantage over conventional radiation therapy alone in treating locally recurrent rectal carcinoma.", "matched_patterns": [["NN IN JJ NN", "effectiveness of local hyperthermia"], ["NN IN JJ NN", "duration of local control"], ["NN IN JJ NN", "advantage over conventional radiation"],

The results showed that both appliances improved the dental and skeletal vertical relationships, but the magnet group had a faster response and successfully closed the open bite in under 4 months, especially in patients in early mixed dentition. However, the magnet group also experienced transverse problems such as unilateral cross-bite and scissor-bite on the opposite side. The study concluded that repelling magnets can be an effective appliance for treating anterior open bite, but their use should be monitored closely to avoid transverse problems.\n\nThe second study evaluated the effects of Fr\u00e4nkel's function regulator (FR-4) appliance on the treatment of Angle Class I skeletal anterior open bite malocclusion in 40 Turkish children.

The authors conducted a systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with high-risk endometrial cancer. The review included six RCTs that compared adjuvant chemotherapy with radiotherapy or no treatment in patients with high-risk endometrial cancer. The primary outcomes evaluated were overall survival, progression-free survival, and adverse effects.\n\nThe results of the review showed that adjuvant chemotherapy did not significantly improve overall survival or progression-free survival compared to radiotherapy or no treatment in patients with high-risk endometrial cancer. However, there was a trend towards improved progression-free survival in patients receiving chemotherapy, particularly in those with stage III or IV disease.\n\nThe review also found that adjuvant chemotherapy was associated with a higher risk of acute toxicity, such as nausea, vomiting, and leucopenia, but the rate of severe toxicity was low. In addition, chemotherapy appeared to increase the risk of bowel complications, such as small bowel obstruction and intestinal perforation.\n\nThe authors concluded that the use of adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with high-risk endometrial cancer is still controversial and that further research is needed to determine its effectiveness and safety.

The study involved 600 women who were randomly divided into two groups: an intervention group that received counseling and educational leaflets, and a control group that did not receive any formal contraceptive advice. The results showed that there was a significant increase in contraceptive uptake among women in the intervention group, with a shift towards more reliable methods. In contrast, the control group had a lower rate of contraceptive use, with a higher proportion of women using less reliable methods. The study concluded that providing counseling and educational leaflets can effectively promote contraceptive use among couples.\n\nAnother study evaluated the effectiveness of a personalized counseling on contraceptive acceptability and use among postabortion women in Brazil. The results showed that the strategy of individualized contraceptive counseling increased the acceptance and use of contraceptive methods, and improved the adequate use of the methods.\n\nA controlled field trial study in Iran evaluated the effects of community-based distribution (CBD) on contraceptive usage. The results showed that using CBD increased the level of contraceptive knowledge, enhanced correct contraceptive choice by couples, improved contraceptive usage, and improved contraceptive continuation rates.\n\nA randomized controlled trial in Syria assessed the effect of postnatal home visits on maternal postpartum morbidities, infant morbidity, uptake of postpartum care, use of contraceptive methods, and selected neonatal health practices. The results showed that postnatal home visits significantly increased exclusive breastfeeding, but did not affect other outcomes.\n\nFinally, a study investigated the impact of antenatal counseling on couples' knowledge and practice of contraception. The results showed that counseling sessions improved the couples' knowledge and practice of contraception, and involving husbands in family planning counselling sessions led to joint decisions being made and encouraged women's use of contraception.

{"original_summary": "Although antibiotic treatment is effective for the cure of urinary tract infections, there are insufficient data to recommend any specific drug regimen for treatment of symptomatic urinary tract infections during pregnancy. All the antibiotics studied were shown to be very effective in decreasing the incidence of the different outcomes. Complications were very rare. All included trials had very small sample sizes to reliably detect important differences between treatments. Future studies should evaluate the most promising antibiotics, in terms of class, timing, dose, acceptability, maternal and neonatal outcomes and costs.", "generated_summary": "  The article discusses the treatment and management of urinary tract infections (UTIs) and pyelonephritis during pregnancy. The authors highlight the importance of early diagnosis and treatment to prevent complications and ensure a positive pregnancy outcome.\n\nOne study compared the efficacy of a single dose of fosfomycin trometamol with a 3-day course of ceftibuten in treating acute cystitis in pregnant women. The results showed that both regimens were effective, with a clinical cure rate of 95.2% for fosfomycin trometamol and 90.0% for ceftibuten. However, the study also noted that long-term chemoprophylaxis may be necessary in patients with recurrent UTIs or following acute pyelonephritis during pregnancy.\n\nAnother study compared the efficacy and safety of cefuroxime and cephradine in treating acute pyelonephritis during pregnancy. The results showed that cefuroxime was more effective and better tolerated than cephradine, with a clinical cure rate of 78.8% compared to 59.2%. Additionally, cefuroxime had a lower rate of resistance to uropathogens.\n\nA third study evaluated the efficacy of a therapeutic course of intravenous antibiotics followed by oral antibiotics in preventing recurrent urinary tract infections. The results showed that completion of a 10-day course of oral nitrofurantoin did not significantly reduce the risk of recurrent pyelonephritis immediately post-parenteral treatment.\n\nA fourth study compared the effectiveness of three antibiotic regimens for the treatment of acute pyelonephritis during pregnancy. The results showed that there were no significant differences in clinical response or birth outcomes among subjects treated with ampicillin and gentamicin, cefazolin, or ceftriaxone.\n\nFinally, a fifth study compared outpatient and inpatient management of acute pyelonephritis in pregnancy beyond 24 weeks' gestation. The results showed that there were no significant differences in clinical responses or birth outcomes between inpatients and outpatients treated for acute pyelonephritis, but 30% of outpatients were unable to complete their assigned protocols.\n\nOverall, the studies suggest that early diagnosis and treatment of UTIs and pyelonephritis during pregnancy are crucial to prevent complications and ensure a positive pregnancy outcome.

{"original_summary": "There is insufficient evidence to determine possible advantages or disadvantages of immediate, immediate-delayed or delayed implants, therefore these preliminary conclusions are based on few underpowered trials often judged to be at high risk of bias. There is a suggestion that immediate and immediate-delayed implants may be at higher risks of implant failures and complications than delayed implants on the other hand the aesthetic outcome might be better when placing implants just after teeth extraction. There is not enough reliable evidence supporting or refuting the need for augmentation procedures at immediate implants placed in fresh extraction sockets or whether any of the augmentation techniques is superior to the others.", "generated_summary": "  This study compared the effects of immediate versus delayed placement of titanium dental implants with acid-etched surfaces (Osseotite) in extraction sockets, and evaluated the crestal bone changes and soft tissue response. Forty-six patients were randomly allocated to the immediate or delayed group, and received one implant each in the maxilla or mandible. The results showed that both groups had a high survival rate (91% and 96%, respectively), and the reduction in parallel width, perpendicular width, and depth of the largest defect was statistically significant over time in both groups. However, the immediate group had a higher degree of bone healing in infrabony defects than in dehiscence-type defects, and 70% of the 3-wall infrabony defects with a parallel width of up to 5 mm, a depth of maximum 4 mm, and a perpendicular width of maximum 2 mm had a capacity of spontaneous healing within a period of 3 months.\n\nThe study also compared the clinical success of immediately placed implants in chronic periapical infected sites. Fifty patients were included in the study, with 25 patients receiving immediately placed Frialit-2 Synchro implants and 25 patients receiving implants placed after a 3-month healing period. The results showed that the survival rate was 92% for the immediately placed implants and 100% for the delayed implants, and there were no significant differences in mean implant stability quotient values, gingival aesthetics, radiographic bone loss, and microbiologic characteristics of periapical lesions between the two groups.\n\nAnother study compared the immediate restoration of single implants in the esthetic zones performed on implants placed immediately after tooth extraction or 8 weeks later. Sixteen patients were treated with tapered effect (TE) implants, and the results showed that there were no statistically significant differences in marginal bone resorption, papilla index, and position of the mucosal margin between the two groups. The implant stability quotient values were significant at the moment of implant placement but not at the moment of delivery of the definitive restoration.\n\nA study compared the efficacy of combinations of membranes and autogenous bone grafts at immediate implants. Sixty-two patients received an immediate implant for a single tooth replacement, and the results showed that all groups showed significant reduction in vertical defect height, horizontal defect depth, and horizontal defect width. However, there were no significant differences between groups in HDW reduction, and membrane-treated groups showed the greatest reduction in HDW. In the presence of dehiscence defects of the labial plate, HDW reduction of 66.6% was achieved with membrane use compared to 37.7% without membranes.\n\nA study evaluated the hard and soft tissue response to immediate versus delayed implant placement after tooth removal, with immediate provisionalization, in maxillary anterior sites. Seventy-six patients were randomized into treatment groups, and the results showed that there were no significant differences between groups in implant integration or crestal interdental bone movement. However, the bone level on the implants did move from the baseline levels during the first 6 months but not thereafter, and there was a significant difference in the position of the facial gingival margin between the immediate and delayed groups.\n\nFinally, a study evaluated healing of marginal defects in immediate transmucosal implants grafted with anorganic bovine bone, and assessed mucosal and radiographic outcomes 3-4 years following restoration. Thirty immediate transmucosal implants were placed in maxillary anterior extraction sites, and the results showed that BioOss significantly reduced horizontal resorption of buccal bone. However, there was a risk of mucosal recession and adverse soft tissue esthetics with immediate implant placement, and this risk may be reduced by avoiding a buccal position of the implant in the extraction socket.", "matched_patterns": [["NN IN JJ NN", "reduction in parallel width,"], ["NN IN JJ NN", "resorption of buccal bone."], ["NN IN JJ NN", "risk of mucosal recession"], ["NN IN JJ NN",

The study suggests that these interventions can be effective in preventing high blood pressure.", "matched_patterns": [["IN JJ NN CC", "that weight loss and"], ["NN IN NN NN", "combination on blood pressure"], ["JJ NN CC NN", "weight loss and sodium"], ["JJ NN VBD IN", "3-4 years, found that"], ["VBD IN JJ NN", "found that weight loss"], ["IN JJ NNS IN", "in overweight adults with"], ["NN CC NN NN", "loss and sodium reduction,"], ["NN CC NN NN", "loss and sodium reduction"], ["JJ NNS IN JJ", "overweight adults with high-normal"], ["NN VBD IN JJ", "years, found that weight"], ["IN JJ NN VBD", "over 3-4 years, found"], ["DT NN VBZ IN", "The study suggests that"], ["NN NN NN CC", "loss, sodium reduction, and"], ["VBN IN JJ NN", "conducted over 3-4 years,"], ["NN VBD IN JJ NN", "years, found that weight loss"], ["IN JJ NN CC NN", "that weight loss and sodium"], ["JJ NN VBD IN JJ", "3-4 years, found that weight"], ["JJ NN VBD IN JJ NN", "3-4 years, found that weight loss"]]}
{"original_summary": "Most Chinese medical herbs in the included studies showed similar effects to antiviral drugs in preventing or treating influenza. Few were shown to be superior to antiviral drugs. No obvious adverse events were reported in the included studies. However, current evidence remains weak due to methodological limitations of the trials. More high-quality RCTs with larger numbers of participants and clear reporting are needed.", "generated_summary": "  This study investigated the effectiveness and safety of Antiwei, a traditional Chinese prescription, in treating influenza. In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 480 adults with influenza-like symptoms were recruited and randomly assigned to receive either Antiwei or placebo twice daily for three days. The results showed that Antiwei significantly increased patients' recovery rate by 17% and reduced the severity of illness compared to placebo in both the influenza-like and influenza-confirmed populations. In the influenza-confirmed population, Antiwei also reduced the severity of fever, cough, and expectoration after one day of treatment. The adverse event profiles were similar for Antiwei and placebo. The study concluded that Antiwei is effective and well-tolerated in treating natural influenza infection in adults and represents a valuable intervention in the management of influenza.", "matched_patterns": [["NN IN JJ NN", "severity of fever, cough,"], ["IN DT JJ NN", "In the influenza-confirmed population,"], ["IN DT JJ NN", "In a randomized, double-blind"], ["DT NN IN JJ", "the severity of fever,"], ["IN DT NN IN", "in the management of"], ["NN IN DT NN", "intervention in the management"], ["DT JJ NN IN", "a valuable intervention in"], ["DT NN IN NN", "the severity of illness"], ["DT NN IN NN", "the management of influenza."], ["NN CC NN IN", "effectiveness and safety of"], ["NN CC NN IN", "cough, and expectoration after"], ["DT NN VBD IN", "The study concluded that"], ["JJ NN IN DT", "valuable intervention in the"], ["IN JJ NN CC", "of fever, cough, and"], ["JJ NN NN IN", "patients' recovery rate by"], ["VBD DT NN IN", "reduced the severity of"], ["JJ JJ NN IN", "natural influenza infection in"], ["JJ JJ NN IN", "traditional Chinese prescription, in"], ["JJ NN CC NN", "fever, cough, and expectoration"], ["DT NN CC NN", "the effectiveness and safety"], ["NN VBD DT NN", "study investigated the effectiveness"], ["JJ NN IN NNS", "influenza infection in adults"], ["JJ CC JJ NN", "influenza-like and influenza-confirmed populations."], ["DT NN IN JJ NN", "the severity of fever, cough,"], ["NN IN DT NN IN", "intervention in the management of"], ["JJ NN IN DT NN", "valuable intervention in the management"], ["NN IN JJ NN CC", "severity of fever, cough, and"], ["DT NN CC NN IN", "the effectiveness and safety of"], ["IN DT NN IN NN", "in the management of influenza."], ["VBD DT NN IN JJ", "reduced the severity of fever,"], ["IN JJ NN CC NN", "of fever, cough, and expectoration"], ["JJ NN CC NN IN", "fever, cough, and expectoration after"], ["VBD DT NN IN NN", "reduced the severity of illness"], ["DT JJ NN IN DT", "a valuable intervention in the"], ["JJ NN IN DT NN IN", "valuable intervention in the management of"], ["DT NN IN JJ NN CC", "the severity of fever, cough, and"], ["VBD DT NN IN JJ NN", "reduced the severity of fever, cough,"], ["NN IN DT NN IN NN", "intervention in the management of influenza."], ["DT JJ NN IN DT NN", "a valuable intervention in the management"], ["VBD DT NN CC NN IN", "investigated the effectiveness and safety of"], ["NN IN JJ NN CC NN", "severity of fever, cough, and expectoration"], ["NN VBD DT NN CC NN", "study investigated the effectiveness and safety"], ["DT JJ NN IN DT NN IN", "a valuable intervention in the management of"], ["JJ NN IN DT NN IN NN", "valuable intervention in the management of influenza."], ["NN VBD DT NN CC NN IN", "study investigated the effectiveness and safety of"]]}
