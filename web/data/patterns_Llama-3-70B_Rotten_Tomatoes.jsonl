Many critics praise Pacino's performance, calling it one of his best and most convincing portrayals.

While some critics find the script and direction weak, others appreciate the film's thought-provoking exploration of denial and its relevance to current events.

Many reviewers find the film's attempts at humor to be unsuccessful, with some calling it \"laughless\" and \"gogglingly slow.\" Uma Thurman's performance is described as both funny and overstated, but ultimately not enough to save the film from its overall shortcomings. The movie is panned for its whiny and self-involved portrayal of motherhood, with some critics finding it embarrassing to watch.

{"original_summary": "This sequel to the live-action 101 Dalmatians is simply more of the same.

The critics are divided, with some finding it to be a fun, lighthearted, and entertaining family film, while others consider it to be a lazy, formulaic, and overly loud sequel that lacks the charm of the original.\n\nSome reviewers praise the film's colorful visuals, sight gags, and the performances of Glenn Close and Gerard Depardieu. They note that the movie is suitable for families with older children, but may be too intense for younger kids due to some scary scenes and perilous situations.\n\nOn the other hand, many critics pan the film for its contrived script, heavy-handed direction, and lack of originality. They argue that the movie relies too heavily on slapstick humor and that the human characters are weird and unengaging. Some reviewers also express disappointment that the sequel does not live up to the standard set by the original, with one calling it a \"typical sequel from hell.\"\n\nOverall, the reviews suggest that \"102 Dalmatians\" is a middling family film that may appeal to some viewers but will likely disappoint others.", "matched_patterns": [["NN IN DT NN", "disappointment that the sequel"], ["NN IN DT NN", "charm of the original."], ["DT JJ NN IN", "a \"typical sequel from"], ["IN DT JJ NN", "On the other hand,"], ["DT NN IN DT", "the charm of the"], ["JJ NN IN DT", "live-action remake of the"], ["NN IN DT JJ", "remake of the classic"], ["JJ NN IN NN", "\"typical sequel from hell.\""], ["IN DT NN VBZ", "that the movie relies"], ["IN DT NN VBZ", "that the movie is"], ["IN DT NN VBZ", "that the sequel does"], ["IN DT NN IN", "by the original, with"], ["DT NNS VBP IN", "The reviews are for"], ["DT NNS VBP IN", "the reviews suggest that"], ["JJ NN WDT VBZ", "loud sequel that lacks"], ["NNP NNP VBZ DT", "\"102 Dalmatians\" is a"], ["NNP NNP VBZ DT", "\"102 Dalmatians\" (2000), a"], ["NN CC NN IN", "direction, and lack of"], ["NNS VBP DT NN", "critics pan the film"], ["NNS VBP DT NN", "reviewers praise the film's"], ["DT JJ NN CC", "a fun, lighthearted, and"], ["DT JJ NN CC", "a lazy, formulaic, and"], ["VBP IN DT NN", "are for the movie"], ["VBP IN DT NN", "argue that the movie"], ["VBP IN DT NN", "note that the movie"], ["JJ NN CC NN", "heavy-handed direction, and lack"], ["IN DT NNS VBP", "Overall, the reviews suggest"], ["NNS VBP IN DT", "reviews are for the"], ["VBN IN DT NN", "set by the original,"], ["VBZ DT NN IN", "lacks the charm of"], ["DT NNS VBP DT", "Some reviewers praise the"], ["NNP NNP CC NNP", "Glenn Close and Gerard"], ["NN NN NN CC", "visuals, sight gags, and"], ["NNP CC NNP NNP", "Close and Gerard Depardieu."], ["JJ NNS VBP DT", "many critics pan the"], ["NNP VBZ DT NN", "Dalmatians\" (2000), a sequel"], ["DT NN VBZ JJ", "the movie is suitable"], ["TO VB DT JJ", "to be a fun,"], ["TO VB DT JJ", "to be a lazy,"], ["DT NN IN DT NN", "the charm of the original."], ["IN DT NNS VBP IN", "Overall, the reviews suggest that"], ["NNS VBP IN DT NN", "reviews are for the movie"], ["NNP NNP CC NNP NNP", "Glenn Close and Gerard Depardieu."], ["DT JJ NN IN NN", "a \"typical sequel from hell.\""], ["VBP IN DT NN VBZ", "argue that the movie relies"], ["VBP IN DT NN VBZ", "note that the movie is"], ["DT NNS VBP IN DT", "The reviews are for the"], ["VBZ DT NN IN DT", "lacks the charm of the"], ["NNP NNP VBZ DT NN", "\"102 Dalmatians\" (2000), a sequel"], ["JJ NNS VBP DT NN", "many critics pan the film"], ["DT NNS VBP DT NN", "Some reviewers praise the film's"], ["NN CC NN IN NN", "direction, and lack of originality."], ["VBN IN DT NN IN", "set by the original, with"], ["DT NNS VBP IN NNP", "the reviews suggest that \"102"], ["JJ NN IN DT JJ", "live-action remake of the classic"], ["TO VB DT JJ NN", "to be a lazy, formulaic,"], ["TO VB DT JJ NN", "to be a fun, lighthearted,"], ["DT NNS VBP IN DT NN", "The reviews are for the movie"], ["VBZ DT NN IN DT NN", "lacks the charm of the original."], ["IN DT NNS VBP IN NNP", "Overall, the reviews suggest that \"102"], ["IN NNP NNP CC NNP NNP", "of Glenn Close and Gerard Depardieu."], ["DT NNS VBP IN NNP NNP", "the reviews suggest that \"102 Dalmatians\""], ["IN DT NNS VBP IN NNP NNP", "Overall, the reviews suggest that \"102 Dalmatians\""], ["DT NNS VBP IN NNP NNP VBZ", "the reviews suggest that \"102 Dalmatians\" is"], ["NNS VBP IN NNP NNP VBZ DT", "reviews suggest that \"102 Dalmatians\" is a"], ["NNS IN NNP NNP CC NNP NNP", "performances of Glenn Close and Gerard Depardieu."], ["IN DT NNS VBP IN NNP NNP VBZ", "Overall, the reviews suggest that \"102 Dalmatians\" is"], ["DT NNS VBP IN NNP NNP VBZ DT", "the reviews suggest that \"102 Dalmatians\" is a"]]}
