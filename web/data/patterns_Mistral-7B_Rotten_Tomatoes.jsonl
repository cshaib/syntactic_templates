The film follows the unlikely relationship between Penelope (Alexi Pappas), a cross-country skier who has yet to make it to the big leagues, and Ezra (Mark Duplass), a dentist and volunteer at the Olympic Village. Both Penelope and Ezra are slightly neurotic and harbor dreams of achieving something significant in their respective fields.\n\nAs they spend more time together, they open up to each other about their fears, insecurities, and aspirations. The film explores the raw emotional intimacy that can develop between two people who are both flawed but genuinely care for each other. However, the narrative is somewhat random and awkwardly constructed, with moments of improvisation that feel forced and disjointed.\n\nDespite its flaws, \"Olympic Dreams\" is an engaging and often charming film that showcases the unique atmosphere of the Olympic Games.

The story revolves around Mara (Alice Englert), the daughter of Pastor Lemuel (Walton Goggins), who is engaged to be married to a man of his choosing, but her heart belongs to a young man named Orpheus (Thomas Mann). As Mara and Orpheus's relationship deepens, tensions rise within the community, leading to a tragic event that tests their faith and love.

{"original_summary": "The Great Hack offers an alarming glimpse of the way data is being weaponized for political gain -- and what it might mean for future elections.", "generated_summary": " \"The Great Hack\" is a documentary directed by Jehane Noujaim and Karim Amer that explores the Cambridge Analytica scandal, which raised concerns about the misuse of personal data and its influence on past elections, particularly Brexit and the US presidential campaign. The film is a gripping and visually stunning examination of how innocent likes and shares became the building blocks of these political campaigns. It features interviews with key figures involved in the scandal, including whistleblower Christopher Wylie and former Cambridge Analytica employee Brittany Kaiser. The documentary raises important questions about individual data rights, the sinister side of widespread connectivity, and the role of tech giants in democratic processes. While it offers a warning about the misuse of personal data and its potential impact on future elections, some critics argue that the film is vapid and lacks a satisfying end point.
